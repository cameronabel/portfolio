    <h1 class="centered">Hello!</h1>
    <p>I have been working in Retirement Plan Administration and Consultation for the better part of a
      decade. While the job itself is... on the <em>dull</em> side (so many spreadsheets!), the most rewarding aspect is
      considering a client's special set of circumstances and designing a plan that truly does <em>work for</em> them.
      Whether they have unique office demographics, fluctuating budgetary concerns, or need assistance meeting
      compliance requirements, every plan is a puzzle to solve.</p>
    <p>The industry has a great many tools at its disposal, but seldom do they cooperate with each
      other - often
      requiring human intervention at each step in the process to ensure the applications and services are playing nice.
      The very first "real project" that I ever attempted was a program that could do the bulk of my tedious Excel work
      in order to interface with a variety of custodial firms' financial reports (each in their own format, <em>of
        course</em>). Thus I discovered my true passion in this field: streamlining workflow by automating away the
      tedium and building a better interface by which these tools and systems can interconnect.</p>
    <p>I am a native Pacific Northwesterner - born and raised in the greater Portland area. I live here
      now with my darling wife and son, plus a couple of our furry friends.</p>
