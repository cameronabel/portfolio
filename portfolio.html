        <h2>Advent of Code</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> is an annual celebration, competition, and
          generally fun exercise that takes place each year beginning December 1st thru the 25th.</p>
        <p>Participants can use whatever means or languages they are comfortable with to solve themed puzzles, two per
          day during the month. Puzzles are generally more difficult as the month progresses and often build off prior
          days' solutions. For instance, one year's theme involved coding a "computer" (more of an API) that could
          process the puzzle's input. The computer was required to handle more complex instructions as the event
          progressed.</p>
        <p>My solutions are generally written in <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>, but my AoC repository is
          woefully underserved.</p>

        <h2>Epicodus</h2>
        <p>Epicodus is a full or part-time code school located in Portland, Oregon. I am actively completing the
          curriculum for this school.</p>
        <h3>Some Epicodus practice projects include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/cameronabel/epicodus_mfw">"My First Website"</a></li>

        <h2>Pivotr</h2>
        <p>Pivotr was my first large-scale project, and the first large project to be actively used by myself and
          colleagues in the workplace.</p>
        <p>This program aims to automate tedious processes involved in converting financial institution reporting files
          (generally in .txt, .csv, or .xlsx format) into a cleaned up, human-readable, pivoted format that is ready for
          analysis.</p>
        <p>This project is written in Python, using <a href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a> as the GUI framework and
          leaning heavily on <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> for tabular data processing. Data scrubbing
          processes that would typically take 15-25 minutes were reduced to seconds without the bloat of Excel weighing
          them down. In general, the program would produce and export the data in Excel format in less time than Excel
          takes to open on the user's machine.</p>

        <h3>TODOs:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Continue to refactor and improve existing code</li>
          <li>Improve compatibility with additional financial co's</li>
          <li>Remove the stacked/tabbed export options in favor of a user-defined custom layout</li>
          <li>Add additional functionality to error/sanity check the data</li>

        <h2>PyDis</h2>
        <p>PyDis is the largest semi-official Discord server for the Python programming language. The server boasts over
          100,000 members, numerous topical channels on software design, security, bots/webcrawlers, and "softer" skills
          related to building a career with Python.</p>
        <p>I have been a contributing member of this project for several years, and a staff member of the channel since
          2020.</p>
